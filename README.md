This project implements a binary text classification system to distinguish between flirty and non-flirty messages using TF-IDF vectorization and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation with classification reports and confusion matrices, and visualizations to analyze performance.
